The aim of this Help Centre is to be a comprehensive guide to your Business Management Software (BMS).

In the [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/core-logging-in-and-out/) section (above), we cover topics that will help you navigate through BMS, as well as various ways to use the software more efficiently.

Whilst in the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) section, we have information on all the latest software releases.

## So what is BMS, exactly?

BMS is a unified suite of applications that aims to provide a 'single source of truth' for your valuable customer data.

It's configured as a hosted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution to take advantage of the redundancy, scalability and efficiency inherent in managed, cloud based software. For complete accessibility, the interface is optimised to work seamlessly across all manner of device sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) via responsive design principles.

BMS features <a class="noRedirect" href="http://www.bmserp.com/applications" target="_blank">applications</a> for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ), Billing and Revenue Management (BRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Service Lifecycle Management (SLM). We believe that our core applications add great value when combined in the one unified suite - a single customer file, tracking all interactions, for consolidated work-flow and reporting.

A broad selection of <a class="noRedirect" href="http://www.bmserp.com/extensions" target="_blank">extensions and integrations</a> provide powerful new features and services to enhance the BMS suite. In-built flexibility allows for individual customisation, with a number of industry solutions available to facilitate customisation at a lower total cost of ownership.
